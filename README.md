# Punman App
Punman is a beginner friendly application that allows unauthenticated users to post their favourite pun for all to see.

## Why?
Punman has deliberately been kept simple to focus on the following containerization concepts;
- Building of isolated independent containers for different parts of the app i.e.front-end, backend and the database.
- Usage of docker compose to startup all the relevant services that makeup the complete application.
- Usage of container orchestration services to setup a microservice application

This is the starter code. The tutorials will build upon this code.
- Tutorial 1
- Tutorial 2
- Tutorial 3

## Technologies used
- PREN for the application
- Docker for building images
- Docker compose for running the complete app from the built images
- Kubernetes for container orchestration
